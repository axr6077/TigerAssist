# TigerAssist

In our society, there is a persistent language barrier between the hearing and the deaf. To bridge this gap, we created TigerAssist, a machine learning-based application that converts the alphabet of the American Sign Language to the English language. The program utilizes machine learning algorithms as well as virtual reality, computer vision and big data processing to parse live sign language gestures to text. 

## Getting Started

Software: 
Install Python 36 
Install PyCharm or any text editor 
Clone the repo 
python main.py 

Hardware:
